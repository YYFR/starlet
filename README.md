## Introduction

This website aims to provide end-to-end management services for rental property portfolios. It helps landlords find suitable tenants, facilitates property purchases and handles compliance and repairs.

## About

I chose to create this website as I had done some work in the property field.
The goal of this site is to reassure and provide peace of mind to landlords, the reviews section shows that they will be in good hands. This website has been made with a clear goal of providing peace of mind to property owners, which can be seen on the home page and the services.html page. The contact button has been designed as a strong call to action to allow potential customers to get in touch.

## Problems

I have had many stressfull problems whilst creating this site.
Firstly I had been using the terminal incorrectly, which resulted in none of my work being submitted to GitHub for the first part of my project. I also stupidly didn't document my problems straight away and relied on remebering my problems which didn't work.

I have also tried to use Bootstrap in my project, however I only added it in middle of the project so it messed up some of the styles that were already working well, so I decided not to include it.

Another problem as seen in the Screenshot, was that I was trying to create 3 boxes to showcase our services, but I was trying to use a table to do that which wasn't ideal.

I also struggled with making sure the #cover-text works on smaller devices.

I fixed this html test fail by removing the section element from the div that was wrapped around the contact-button as it wasn't needed.

I fixed this contact.html fail by removing the unnecessary body tag as seen in the screenshot below.

I tried to test the responsiveness of my website by using https://responsivedesignchecker.com/ however I received an error message response.
I fixed this by using the URL from Github Pages and not the URL of the website generated from the coding terminal.

I used https://validator.w3.org to test for bugs in html.

I also used Lighthouse from Chrome develepor tools.

I have used responsivedesignchecker.com to test on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

I have also tested it in Chrome develepor tools on desktop, tablet and mobile, as well as shared the link with some family and friends who viewed it on desktop and mobile devices.

## Credit

I started by looking at a couple of property websites to get a feel for what it should look like, I also looked at previous projects I had worked on to gain some inspiration.

<https://www.w3schools.com/> was also a good tool, they also allow you to run small snippets of code to see how they would work.

I used the Code Institute link https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/ to view submitted data from the contact form.

Images have been downloaded directly from google chrome.

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/): The website uses FontAwesome for displaying icons.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): The website uses the "Inter" and "Playfair" fonts with a fallback of sans-serif.

Last but not least Code Institute for providing me with a great facilitator as well as a great mentor and superb tutor support.
